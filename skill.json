The user must ask the Alexa to tell the no of covid cases in state_name on yyyymmdd\n3. If the user enters only the state name such as\" tell me the no of covid cases in Goa\", then Alexa will ask the user to enter the date in the format yyyyddmm.\n4. After entering the inputs, the user  will be given the output such as \"In the state of Sikkim the new cases on : 2020-12-01 are : 42, recovered cases are : 5 , deceased are : 1\". \n5. When the user enters the present day, since the cases on that day are available by the EOD, hence only for that day, the total no of cases recovered so far, total no of cases deceased so far, and the total no of active cases so far for a state will be shown.\n6. When the user wants to get the info for another state in India, the user should again ask, \"tell me the no of cases in state_name. \"",
